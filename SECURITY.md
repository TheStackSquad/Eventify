Security Policy

We take the security of our application and the trust of our users and contributors seriously. This document outlines our supported versions and the procedure for securely reporting vulnerabilities.

Supported Versions

We apply security updates and critical patches to the following release branches. We encourage all users to run the latest supported version.

Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please do not open a public GitHub issue or discuss it in public channels. This allows us time to fix the issue before it can be exploited.

How to Report

To report a vulnerability, please use the following method:

Use GitHub Security Advisory: Go to the Security tab of this repository, then click "Advisories" and select "Draft a new security advisory".

Provide Details: Clearly describe the nature of the vulnerability, the steps to reproduce it, and the potential impact. If possible, include code snippets or proof-of-concept exploits.

Submit Draft: Save and submit the draft. This opens a private communication channel with the maintainer(s).

What to Expect

Stage

Expected Timeline

Action

Initial Acknowledgment

Within 24 hours

We will confirm receipt and begin triage.

Triage and Analysis

Within 1-5 business days

We will investigate, determine the severity, and confirm if it is a valid vulnerability.

Fix and Disclosure

Negotiable

We will work to create a patch and set a target date for public disclosure. The fix will be committed to a private branch first.

Public Release

Agreed upon date

The patch will be merged into the supported branches, and a public Security Advisory will be published on GitHub, crediting the reporter (if desired).

Public vs. Rejected Reports

Accepted: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work with you on the disclosure timeline and provide credit.

Declined: If the issue is determined to be non-critical, not reproducible, or outside the scope of the project's security concerns, we will explain the reasoning and close the advisory.

We greatly appreciate the efforts of security researchers and thank you for helping us keep this project safe.
